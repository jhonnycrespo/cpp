Initializing Local and Global Variables
=======================================

When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized by the system, you must initialize it yourself. 
Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows:

int = 0
char = '\0'
float = 0
double = 0
pointer = NULL
