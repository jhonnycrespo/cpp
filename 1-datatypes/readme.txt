Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you 
create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

Primitive Built-in Types
========================

Keyword: bool, char, int, float, double, void, wchar_t

Several of the basic types can be modified using one or more of these type modifiers: signed, unsigned, short, long


char = 1 byte
int = 4 bytes
short = 2 bytes
long = 4 bytes
float = 4 bytes
double = 8 bytes
long double = 8 bytes
wchat_t = 2 or 4 bytes

The size of variables might be different from those shown in the above table, depending on the compiler and the computer you are using.
