Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they are called literals.

Constants can be of any of the basic data types and can be divided into Integer Numerals, Floating-Point Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values.

Again, constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.


Defining Constants
==================

There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants:

    - Using #define preprocessor.
    - Using const keyword.
